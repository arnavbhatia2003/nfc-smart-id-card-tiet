# NFC Smart ID Card for TIET Students 🎓📲

This project aims to streamline student services at Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology by using an NFC-enabled smart ID card. The system replaces multiple cards (library, mess, laundry) with a single unified solution, while also integrating energy-saving automation.

## 💡 Features
- Single NFC card for multiple services
- ESP32-based real-time wireless communication (ESP-NOW/WiFi)
- Smart lighting system using presence detection
- Energy-efficient, sustainable campus utility

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **ESP32 Microcontroller**
- **RFID/NFC Module (RC522)**
- **Arduino IDE**
- **ESP-NOW / WiFi Communication**
- **C/C++ Programming**

## 🛠️ Hardware Requirements
- ESP32 development board
- RC522 NFC Module
- Power source
- LEDs/Relays for smart power control

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
2. Upload code to ESP32 using Arduino IDE
3. Configure services based on NFC tag IDs
4. Use serial monitor to test responses
